# Yusaino

Audio playback for Arduino, with compression.

This project is generally the hardware part of Thomas Grill's
[*Compressed audio output for Arduino*](http://grrrr.org/2011/06/30/arduino-compressed_audio/),
with a few improvements. Many thanks for Thomas' thoughts of Huffman encoding and hardware PWM playback.
Copyright information can be found in the header of `Yusaino.Board.ino`.

This repository contains the code running on Arduino. For sound data generation please see
[yusaino-audio](https://github.com/hozuki/yusaino-audio).

## Usage

This project is developed using [Arduino IDE for Visual Studio](http://www.visualmicro.com/). The vanilla
Arduino IDE may work, but I didn't test it.

If you are also using AIVS, please open the solution, focus on project `Yusaino.Board`, and choose
an Arduino board configuration from the Arduino Board Manager dropdown. After that, simply compile and
upload it to the Arduino.

The code and provided audio data is for Arduino Pro Mini, which uses ATmega 328 (**32KiB flash memory**).
For those using ATmega 168, please replace the sound data with data from an audio file with fewer samples.

`sounddata.h` and `sounddata.ino` contained are generated by *yusaino-audio* with
following arguments:

```shell
node yusaino-audio/bin/cli -o sounddata eva_fate.wav
```

The usage of *yusaino-audio* can be found [here](https://github.com/hozuki/yusaino-audio#usage).

## Naming

The name comes from [Kozue Yusa](http://www.project-imas.com/wiki/Kozue_Yusa). But no I am not a
lolicon, faithfully. I just *happened* to win a card of her. â˜º

Another introduction from [Moegirl wiki](https://zh.moegirl.org/zh/%E6%B8%B8%E4%BD%90%E6%A2%A2) (originally
in Chinese):

> Kozue Yusa is a loli idol appearing in The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls.
>
> ---
>
> She was introduced on July 17, 2013, when a new region *Okinawa* opened.
>
> As a loli idol aged 11, her figure data is still below that of an average 9-year-old Japanese girl.
> She is one of the smallest characters in the whole game.
>
> Her inner attributes are unexpectedly immature. She doesn't speak fluently, and she doesn't understand
> the meaning of words like "idol" and "interest" at the first appearance. She isn't even sure about
> her age. So she shows a strong dependency towards others: she needs help to change her clothes<del>,
> a bliss for lolicons</del>; she doesn't feel wrong when changing clothes in front of the public<del>,
> a bliss for lolicons</del>; she takes sitting, leaning and sleeping on the producer for granted<del>,
> a heaven for lolicons</del>.
>
> On the contrary, she has a great talent in memorizing the scripts.
